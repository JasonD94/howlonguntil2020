/*  	Spans are inline by default, but I want the time/type to display on the same line
	which is basically inline-block.
	For example:
	[36 days] [4 hours] [46 minutes] [5 seconds]
	The brackets should always appear on the same line. Looks ugly if 5 appears on one line,
	and then seconds appears below it.
